            <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>For the past few months, me and Joe has teamed up to create a trivia platformer game called "Leap and Learn". We aimed to educate people through games, we asked questions and the player had to choose the right option to pass to the next level, with obstacles in the way throughout your journey. I've been writing blogs to document my process along the way to review for the future. My product educates people about all sorts of different topics through different questions. In the future, how people learn might be more advanced compared to the system we have now, and so what me and Joe have made is our take on how learning would be implemented due to the culture around technology now-a-days.</p>

    <h2>Challenges and Takeaways</h2>
    <p>Throughout the freedom project, working alongside a partner was a new task and challenge for me o tackle. Though I have worked with a partner many times, for the monthlong freedom project, it was different, it required constant communication and we always had to think about what WE wanted to make together as a final product. As we both were learning the same tool, we decided to split what we focused on understanding in order to have a broader understanding of our tool. Throughout the months, we developed out synergy and eventually created leap and learn through our hard work. I also have learned new things from the time we spent together working, I learned that -- everything we wanted to add was a big feature and would be difficult to implement, but through problem decomposition, we brought those big problems down to little manageable problems which we can slowly solve. As seen through the addition of the texts and problems, that feature was possible by first understanding how we would add text in kaboom, then we figured out how to add two portals into the game then coding it so that one killed you while the other won't. All these features were manageable to implement because of we decomposed the problems</p>
