            <p>This project which is called Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) is  project where I had to collaborate with my partner (Nancy) to make an adventure style game in github where each choice leads to different paths. </p>
            <p>For our project, we decided to make it so you had to try to escape the school by doing different actions. Some actions killed you but some helped you escape the school. During this project, communication and planning ahead was a integral part of the process in making this entire project. Before we started doing anything, me and Nancy created a plan which you can see by pressing the link and going to plan.png. Communication became a key point right from the start, this project required us to edit our files independently. At the start we were in the same class so that meant being able to communicate when someone is pushing and who has to pull and when to do so. This changed when classes were moved around after the semester, me and Nancy were no longer in the same class so we had to resort to messaging each other on slack and emailing each other to notify one another of any updates they did. With our early planning and our great communication, we were able to finish realtively early and move on to try to do extra credit which we did. </p>
