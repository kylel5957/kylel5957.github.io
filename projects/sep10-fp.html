            <h2> What this project is about</h2>
            <p>This project required us to use what we learned over the course of the entire year to make a website on a topic. This Freedom project I have been working on throughout SEP-10 tries to educate people about how technology has affected chess now and how it might affect it in the future. The blogs I have been writing is my progress reports on how my product was coming along. My product educates people about technology and how it affects chess, hopes for the future, and even my own thoughts on technologies in the future. In the future, chess culture might be more widespread with more and more players, but with that widespread culture, it might affect social life, we see how kids now are distracted from class becuase they are busy playing chess and that might be a big issue in the future.</p>

            <h2> Challenges I faced making this website</h2>
            <p>Making this website was a challenging feat to accomplish. From first learning HTML and CSS for the first time to learning Bootstrap and external tools was a first for me. The hardest part for me however was understanding how to piece all my knowledge together, but with countless assignments and practice assignments I slowly understood how to put together everything. During this entire time learning, I also learned many different things besides code, I learned that getting help is no shame at all because this is a complicated subject and there is too many things for one person to remember. I also understood personally how to manage my time better with all the new things I was learning. Soon, I will be diving into a new language, Javascript, and everything will start all over again, a new language to learn, a better understanding of how to learn new topics, new projects, and more.   </p>
